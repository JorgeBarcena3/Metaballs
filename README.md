# Metaballs


This project implements the graphics technique called **Metaballs**. This technique is used for simulating organic interaction between different materials (more liquid-oriented).

To implement this system, I have used C++ and the SFML library to create the execution window.

Keep in mind that the implementation of this algorithm is quite expensive because it must be iterated through all the pixels on the screen. Even so, the performance it obtained has been quite adequate.

## Auto-executable file

In the "executable" folder, you can find a file that will extract a folder. By executing the extracted file "Metaballs.exe", you can test the application in real time.
